SASL, JSSE, and Java GSS are often used together. 
For example, a common pattern is for an application to use JSSE for establishing a secure channel, 
and to use SASL for client, username/password-based authentication. 
There are also SASL mechanisms layered on top of GSS-API mechanisms; 
one popular example is a SASL GSS-API/Kerberos v5 mechanism that is used with LDAP.
