# **What is the Converter Method Kata?**
The Converter Method Kata is a basic Code Kata with a set of exercises that a developer can complete to familiarize themselves with the converter method APIs available in [Eclipse Collections](https://github.com/eclipse/eclipse-collections).

Converter methods are methods that allow you to convert from one collection type to another. For example, if you have a `MutableList` and want to convert it to a `MutableSet`, you can use the `toSet()` method. Converter methods are available for both object and primitive collections, and there is support for `Collector` implementations on `Collectors2` for converting from JDK types to Eclipse Collections types. Methods that are prefixed with "to" in Eclipse Collections will always create a new copy of the contents in the target type.

The domain of the Converter Method Kata includes the `Person` class.

# Getting Started
