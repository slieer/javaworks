 * Stack is-a list with push() pop() methods.
 * So can we create a stack by extending an ArrayList class?
 * 
 * No! This implementation violates the Liskov Substitution Principle.
 * Which states that 
 * "Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes
 * without altering the correctness of that program."
 * 
 * In this case ArrayList has multiple methods which stack is not supposed to have (ex clear(), get(i) etc)
 * so objects of ArrayList are not fully replaceable by the objects of stack.
